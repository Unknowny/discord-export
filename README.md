## discord-export

Basic Discord chats archiver.

Data is stored in a jsonlines file per channel, each record is of following structure:  
```
{"type": type_of_the_record, "data": raw_api_response_data, "ts": timestamp}
```  
- `raw_api_response_data` is the API data as seen in official Discord API.
- `timestamp` is a standard unix timestamp of when the record was created.

For something more user friendly see https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter (not as data comprehensive).

#### Notes
- Any synthetic fields generated by this library into `raw_api_response_data` are prefixed with a double underscore.
- Cleaned up message content can be accessed under "__clean_content" field.
- Users who reacted to a message are also archived but not more than 100 users per reaction.
- No new development is planned (unless something breaks) as I've implemented everything I personally needed. But feel free to open an issue with feedback.
