## discord-export

Basic Discord chats archiver.

Data is stored in a jsonlines file per channel, each record is of following structure:  
```
{"type": type_of_the_record, "data": raw_api_response_data, "ts": timestamp}
```  
- `raw_api_response_data` is the API data as seen in official Discord API.
- `timestamp` is a standard unix timestamp of when the record was created.

For something more user friendly see https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter (not as data comprehensive).

#### Requirements

#### Notes
- Any synthetic fields placed by this library into `raw_api_response_data` are prefixed with a double underscore.
- Cleaned up message content can be accessed under "__clean_content" field.
- Users who reacted to a message are also archived but not more than 100 users per reaction.
    - This slow things down considerably given it makes a request for every reaction. If you don't need it, use `--skip-reaction-users` flag.
- No new development is planned (unless something breaks) as I've implemented everything I personally needed. But feel free to open an issue with feedback. 
- Regarding usage of account tokens see token related questions at https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Troubleshooting#general.
  - There exists a fancier / safer method of auth (OAuth2) in theory but I can't be bothered adding all that.
