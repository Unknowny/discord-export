## discord-export

Basic Discord channel archiver.

Data is stored in a jsonlines file per channel, each record is of following structure:  
```
{"type": type_of_the_record, "data": raw_api_response_data}
```  
`raw_api_response_data` is the exact data as seen in official Discord API, any synthetic fields generated by this library are prefixed with a double underscore.

For something simpler and more user friendly see https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter. Note that it is not as data comprehensive.
