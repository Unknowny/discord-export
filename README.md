## discord-export

Basic Discord chats archiver.

Data is stored in a jsonlines file per channel, each record is of following structure:  
```
{"type": type_of_the_record, "data": raw_api_response_data, "ts": timestamp}
```  
- `raw_api_response_data` is the exact data as seen in official Discord API
    - Any synthetic fields generated by this library are prefixed with a double underscore.
- `timestamp` is a standard unix timestamp of when the record was created.

For something more user friendly see https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter (not as data comprehensive).
